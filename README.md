# leanpub-book-skeleton
A skeleton repository for quickly setting up leanpub books. This is a template repository, which means it should be used to initiate new repositories in Github.

This skeleton is a work in progress.

## Work Order

- Initial Act-by-act outline
- Scene outlines by Act
- First Draft

## Building Drafts

To build a draft, run `./bin/build` from the root of the repository.

NOTE: All changes should be made in the drafts folder. The manuscript directory is generated VIA the build script, and changes may not persist.
